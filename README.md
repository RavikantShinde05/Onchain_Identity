# Identity on chain Educate series.

This repo will help you to Learn and understand about what is concordium Blockchain.
An introduction to the Concordium Blockchain where we are covering the core concepts, Design Principles 
and what makes Concordium Blockchain from other Public Blockchains:

## All the chapters will be Explained and learned week by week till 7th: 
- An Introduction to Concordium
- Deep Dive Into Identity
- Exploring Verify & Access with Concordium ID
- Overview of Protocol Level Tokens
- Introduction to Sponsored Transactions
- X402 Payments on Concordium
- Advanced Technical Concepts

## Key Insights: 
- Concordium is a Layer-1 blockchain with mandatory, privacy-preserving identity verification built into its consensus layer, utilizing zero-knowledge proof technology.
- Under new leadership, Concordium has pivoted from general Web3 to payment finance infrastructure, targeting the $300 billion daily stablecoin settlement market.
- Protocol-level tokens eliminate smart contract risks by being issued directly at the consensus layer, with built-in features that provide the infrastructure for compliance-ready use cases.
- By embedding identity, jurisdictional control, and auditability at the protocol level, Concordium is positioning itself as a purpose-built settlement layer for the emerging Payment Finance (PayFi) ecosystem.

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. Identity Layer

* Users are verified through identity providers
* Zero-knowledge proofs protect user privacy
* Enables compliance without exposing personal data

### 2. Smart Contracts

* Written in **Rust**
* Secure and efficient execution
* Deployed using WebAssembly (Wasm)

### 3. Consensus Mechanism

* Proof-of-Stake based (ConcordiumBFT)
* Fast finality
* High throughput

### 4. Privacy + Compliance

* Selective disclosure of identity
* Auditable when required by authorities
